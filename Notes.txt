- I'm assuming the file/corresponding object model fits in memory
- I'm assuming the JSON file doesn't change (this is different from the real world I suppose, but again in real world
  I'd probably deal with DB and wouldn't need to store/update the whole file in memory). I'm also assuming I only need
  to read the file once - which means API server initializes the library I'm designing once and then makes multiple
  calls to get different playlists.
- Can a content have > 1 video with the same attributes (which will be played one after another)?
  (In which case I'd assume the order of these videos in the file matters and defines in which order they are shown)
- (follow up from previous assumption) I'm assuming prerolls only associate with videos based on attributes.
  Which means if a content can have > 1 video with the same attributes all preroll videos will be shown before the
  first content video with the same attributes, i.e. if a content has 2 videos with the same attributes there's no
  way to associate any preroll video with the 2nd content video - all preroll videos will be played before all the
  content videos (with the same attributes).
